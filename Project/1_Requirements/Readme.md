# ABSTRACT


Water tank overflow is a common problem which leads to the wastage of water. This circuit will detect the water level and will turn the lever on or off depending on the level. 
Water level indicator is a modern way of measuring the water level using latest technologies like sensors, Arduino. The main aim of the project is to observe the water level at 
any instant of time using Arduino, Servo Motor and Ultrasonic sensor to make it possible. As the servo motor used as an actuator will turn off when the tank fulls with water so 
that the water will not overflow. This may be useful in saving water from getting waste.




# Requirements


# High Level Requirements

# HLR1 Servo Motor ON/OFF
# HLR2 UV Sensor to test the level of water
# HLR3 2 LED to detect servo should be turned on or off





# Low Level Requirements

# LLR1 
The servo motor which works as an actuator in this model turns on when the water level goes below 50% and turns off when the sensor detects that the water has reached the maximum level. This saves time and also brings the concept of automation in my project

# LLR2
There is an UV sensor in the system to detect the level of water at any instant of time. This will help to save a lot of water and also avoid the tank to go waterless. Also it will avoid overfilling of the tank

# LLR3
There are two LED connected to detect the level. The first will glow when the level is less than 50% and other will glow when the level touches max point. 

# LLR4
There is a potentiometer to check the regulation of supply properly.
